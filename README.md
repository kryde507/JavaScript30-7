### Links

- Solution URL: [https://github.com/kryde507/JavaScript30-7](https://github.com/kryde507/JavaScript30-7)

## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

In this project I practiced using array methods, especially with object arrays. I learned how to use the some, every and find methods to get information from an array.


The following JavaScript snippet is used to determine if there are any people over 19 in the array:
```js
 const today = new Date();
        const currYear = today.getFullYear();

        const nineteen = people.some(person => (currYear - person.year) >= 19);
```


### Continued development

I would like to get more practice using array methods to retrieve information from objects within an array. 

### Useful resources

- [FreeCodeCamp Array of Objects Tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-array-of-objects-tutorial-how-to-create-update-and-loop-through-objects-using-js-array-methods/) - This is a resource I used to determine how to use array methods on arrays of objects.
